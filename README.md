pingmii is a Discord Bot for detecting when an amiibots amiibo is at a specified amount of games and disabling it.

## How to use
Make sure you have [python3](https://www.python.org) and pip installed

Open up a command prompt in the folder and type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`

When the requirements finish installing, type `py main.py` in the command prompt

If it is your first time running the bot, it'll ask you some config questions
